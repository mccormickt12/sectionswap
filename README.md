sectionswap
===========

Section Swap is a node app using Mongoose (MongoDB).  This is my first node app and my first app using any DB.
The point of this app is to allow people to go to their class, enter their current section and desired section 
and find swaps for people.  On the more technical side, this app should be able to find cycles in sections.

EX.

Student A has section 1 and wants 2
Student B has section 2 and wants 3
Student C has section 3 and wants 1

It should be able to see that all three students can be happy and help them all get their desired section.
